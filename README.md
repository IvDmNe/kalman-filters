This repository contains:
 - discrete state space model;
 - linear discrete state space model;
 - Extended Kalman Filter;
 - Unscented Kalman Filter.

All algorithms were implemented in Python using JAX and NumPy. 

To see results, plots and time comparison, refer to [this Jupyter notebook](exps.ipynb).
